# py-spiffe

[![CI](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/py-spiffe/actions/workflows/build.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/py-spiffe/actions/workflows/build.yaml?branch=main)

`py-spiffe` is a Python library designed to provide support for [SPIFFE](https://spiffe.io). The library is
structured into two main packages:

### [spiffe](spiffe/README.md)

[![PyPI spiffe](https://badge.fury.io/py/spiffe.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/spiffe/)

The `spiffe` package is the core of the `py-spiffe` library, implementing the SPIFFE specification. It provides
functionality for managing SPIFFE identities, including the Workload API client and automatic handling of X.509 and
JWT SVIDs. This package simplifies working with SPIFFE identities by automating SVID fetching and renewal.

### [spiffe-tls](spiffe-tls/README.md) (experimental)

[![PyPI spiffe-tls](https://badge.fury.io/py/spiffe-tls.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/spiffe-tls/)

The `spiffe-tls` package, still in its experimental stages, is designed to enhance Python applications with TLS utilities
that simplify the integration of SPIFFE authentication. Its primary objective is to ease the process of incorporating
SPIFFE identities into TLS contexts. To achieve this, it offers a set of utility functions that allow for the creation
of TLS listeners and connections, leveraging the [pyOpenSSL](https://pypi.org/project/pyOpenSSL/) library.

## Installation

You can install the `spiffe` and `spiffe-tls` packages directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install spiffe
pip install spiffe-tls
```

## Contributing

Contributions to both `spiffe` and the `spiffe-tls` packages are welcome! Please see
