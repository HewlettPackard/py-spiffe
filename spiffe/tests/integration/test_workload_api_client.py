Integration Tests for the Workload API client.

These tests require a running SPIRE Server and Agent. Before running the tests,
ensure the SPIFFE_ENDPOINT_SOCKET environment variable is correctly set to point
to the SPIRE Agent's Workload API socket path.

These tests also require the presence of a valid registration entry for the calling workload.
